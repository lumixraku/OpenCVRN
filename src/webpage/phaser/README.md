# Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template

A Phaser 3 Project Template


## Start
At first this project was generated by `phaser3-project-template`,  a package that mentioned in offical doc, but there was no typescript config.

Then I followed this article and update webpack version.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-simple-game-in-the-browser-with-phaser-3-and-typescript-bdc94719135/


Then I found [phaser3-typescript-project-template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-typescript-project-template), it was build by rollup.

I prefer rollup than webpack.

### Not compile phaser
By now, you can start to develop. But phaser itself would be packaged into your dist.js each time when you change your code, that would be very slow.

Phaser should be import as a third lib. It should not be package in your dist.js.


Remove `import 'phaser'` in your code. then add phaser.d.ts in your src folder. Add phaser.min.js in html.

## Trouble Shooting



### About webpack config.
If you config baseUrl in tsconfig.json, Go to defintion would works fine in vscode after `window reload`, but webpack does not recoginize it.

You need `TsconfigPathsPlugin` to read module path settings in tsconfig.
